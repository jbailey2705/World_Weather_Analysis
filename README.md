CSV files:
- [WeatherPy_Database.csv](https://github.com/jbailey2705/World_Weather_Analysis/files/9592210/WeatherPy_Database.csv)
- [cities.csv](https://github.com/jbailey2705/World_Weather_Analysis/files/9592219/cities.csv)
Jupyter Notebook files: Weather_Database.ipynb, Vacation_Search.ipynb, Vacation_Itinerary.ipynb
Python: Python v3.7.6, Dependencies: Pandas, Matplotlib, CitiPy, SciPy, Python Requests, APIs, JSON Traversals

## Weather Database
With a random set, 2,000 latitudes and longitudes were generated, an API call was also made on current weather data for the nearest corresponding cities.

API call used to retrieve the following data:

- Latitude and longitude
- Maximum temperature
- Percent humidity
- Percent cloudiness
- Wind speed
- Current Weather description

## Vacation Search
